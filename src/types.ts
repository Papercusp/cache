/**
 * @papercusp/cache — core types.
 *
 * The cache is a tag-based, bumpable-generation cache (Fastly surrogate-keys / Drupal
 * cache-tags model): a cached entry records the data tags it depends on plus the GENERATION
 * each tag had at build time; invalidating a tag bumps its generation, so any entry stamped
 * with an older generation is lazily treated as stale on its next read. No eager purge.
 *
 * Tags and keys are BOTH workspace-scoped (D-010): generations live per (workspaceId, tag),
 * cache keys per (workspaceId, key) — two workspaces can never collide.
